# system-shocks

This project models systems and examines how shocks impact them, with a direct application to economic shocks. 

Broadly, this model can be applied to any system which can be defined with inputs and outputs. In the case of this economic shock example, different industries require different inputs to produce outputs. These industries are connected in a "network-like" structure.
